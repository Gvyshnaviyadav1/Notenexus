<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please install <code>tkinter</code> if you don't have it to view the calendar.</p>
<p><strong> For Linux :</strong>sudo apt install python3-tk</p>
<p><strong>For Mac :</strong>brew install python-tk</p>
<p>pip3 install tkcalendar</p>
<p>If you're running it on <strong>Linux Subsystem</strong>, use <code>serverlinux.py</code> and the same <code>client.py</code> file.<br>
Otherwise, run <code>server.py</code> and <code>client.py</code>.</p>
<p>For dry run please use username and password as mentioned in json file or at top of server code{(username :password)=>alice:alice123;  bob:bob123,  carol:carol123}</p>
<p>First u need to run the server file as per your operating system then u can run the same client file in multiple terminals u can choose few credentials from above ,this will also work across various machines but make sure to change the ip adress of the server and the ip adress client is binding to. </p>
